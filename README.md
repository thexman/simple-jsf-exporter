# Simple JSF Exporter

## What is it?
This is JSF component for exporting data from other components like Primeface's datatable

The problem with existing PrimeFace data table exporters is that it is difficult to customize it (like file format, headers row format, etc.)
If you don't want to use complicated frameworks like com.lapis.jsfexporter, then simple jsf-exporter is what you need.
